# Answers to Technical Questions

## How long did you spend on the coding test?
I spent approximately 3 hours on the coding test. This included time for planning the application structure, implementing the core functionality, and testing to ensure everything worked as intended.

## What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?
In the latest version of JavaScript (ES2021), one of the most useful features added is the `Promise.any()` method. This method takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the promises in the iterable fulfills, returns a single promise that resolves with the value from that promise. If no promises in the iterable fulfill (i.e., all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an AggregateError, a new subclass of Error that groups together individual errors.

### Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how `Promise.any()` can be used:

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.reject('Error 1');
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'Success 2'));
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200, 'Success 3'));

Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result); // Output: "Success 2"
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });

## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To track down a performance issue in production, I would follow these steps:

  Monitoring Tools: Use monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Google Analytics to gather performance metrics and identify slow endpoints or functions.
  Logging: Implement detailed logging to capture execution times for critical operations. This helps in identifying bottlenecks.
  Profiling: Use profiling tools (like Chrome DevTools for front-end applications) to analyze runtime performance and memory usage.
  Replicate the Issue: Try to replicate the issue in a staging environment to analyze it without affecting production.

  Yes, I have encountered performance issues in production before. In one instance, we noticed that a specific API endpoint was taking significantly longer to respond than expected. By using logging and monitoring tools, we identified that a database query was not properly indexed, leading to slow performance. After adding the necessary indexes, the performance improved dramatically.

  ##If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
    If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the task management application:

   User Authentication: Implement user accounts and authentication so that multiple users can manage their tasks independently.
   Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices.
   Dark Mode: Add a dark mode option for better usability in low-light conditions.
